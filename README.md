# ethernet-packet-generator-hardware-prototype
A basic ethernet packet generator hardware prototype description in Verilog-HDL

The objective of this project is to develop a custom hardware for a basic ethernet packet generator. Special emphasis is given only on the packet generation process and the pre-requisites for packet genertaion are assumed to be well known in advance.

This project comprises:
- a ethernet packet generator, i.e., epg.v, design source
- a testbench source, i.e., design_1_wrapper_tb.v

A block design environment has been created, wherein the epg module is included along with few inbuit Xilinx IPs namely, FIFO generator and utility vector logic, as illustrated in the . The
